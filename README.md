## Introduction
Welcome to the Sustainable Hyperloop Transportation project! Our mission is to revolutionize the way people and goods are transported, making it faster, more sustainable, and efficient. This repository is home to the open-source code and documentation for our hyperloop system.

## Project Overview
The hyperloop is a high-speed, sustainable transportation system that uses low-pressure tubes to transport capsules at incredible speeds. This project aims to develop an open-source and sustainable hyperloop system that can be deployed in various locations to reduce carbon emissions and congestion.

## Features
- High-speed capsule transportation.
- Sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
- Minimal environmental impact.
- Efficient route planning and scheduling.
- Scalable and modular design for different use cases.

# Hyperloop Project Hardware Requirements

This document outlines the hardware requirements for the development and operation of a hyperloop transportation system. These hardware components are essential for a functional and safe hyperloop system.

## Tube Infrastructure
- **Tube Material:** High-quality steel or composite tubes designed for low air resistance.
- **Vacuum System:** Pumps and controls to create and maintain a low-pressure environment inside the tube.

## Capsules/Pods
- **Capsules:** Aerodynamically designed capsules for transporting passengers or cargo.
- **Propulsion System:** Efficient propulsion mechanisms, such as linear induction motors or air compressors.
- **Safety Systems:** Emergency brakes and passenger protection mechanisms.

## Power and Energy Systems
- **Electrical Supply:** Electrical power supply systems for the capsules.
- **Energy Sources:** Renewable energy sources (solar, wind) or efficient energy storage solutions.
- **Power Distribution:** Systems for distributing power to various components.

## Guidance and Levitation Systems
- **Guidance Mechanisms:** Magnetic levitation (Maglev) or air cushion systems for levitation and guidance.
- **Control Systems:** Systems for maintaining the position and direction of capsules.

## Control and Communication Systems
- **Control Systems:** Computers and software for managing the hyperloop system.
- **Communication:** Connectivity and safety communication systems.
- **Sensors:** Sensors for monitoring tube and capsule conditions.

## Tube Support and Infrastructure
- **Support Structures:** Pillars or other support structures for holding the tube above the ground.
- **Stations:** Passenger terminals and cargo loading/unloading facilities.

## Safety and Emergency Systems
- **Safety Features:** Emergency exits, ventilation systems, fire detection, and suppression systems.
- **Redundancy:** Fail-safes and redundancy mechanisms for critical systems.

## Regulatory Compliance and Certification
- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with safety standards and regulatory requirements for transportation systems.

## Maintenance and Inspection Equipment
- **Tools:** Equipment for regular maintenance and inspections.

## Testing Facilities
- **Testing Tracks:** Facilities and equipment for testing system components and full-scale prototypes.

## Environmental Control Systems
- **Environmental Control:** Systems to maintain suitable temperatures and humidity levels inside the tube.

# Installation Step 1: Set up the basic classes and constants.
# python
import time

class HyperloopCapsule:
    def __init__(self, name, speed):
        self.name = name
        self.speed = speed
        self.position = 0

    def move(self, time_interval):
        distance = self.speed * time_interval
        self.position += distance

class HyperloopTube:
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length

def simulate_hyperloop():
    tube = HyperloopTube(1000)  # Example tube length of 1000 meters
    capsule = HyperloopCapsule("Capsule 1", speed=120)  # Example speed in m/s

    return tube, capsule

# Step 2: Simulate the hyperloop travel.
def travel_hyperloop(tube, capsule):
    while capsule.position < tube.length:
        capsule.move(1)  # Move the capsule for 1 second
        print(f"{capsule.name} - Position: {capsule.position:.2f} meters")
        time.sleep(1)

    print("Hyperloop capsule reached the end of the tube.")
# Step 3: Run the simulation.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tube, capsule = simulate_hyperloop()
    travel_hyperloop(tube, capsule)
